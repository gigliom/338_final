	<h2>Chevalier Vineyard</h2>
		<p>The Chevalier Vineyard sits on a steep east facing hillside looking over Lake Mendocino. Both Yokayo and Pinole Series soils are present, in the grouping of alluvial river bottom soils pushed up onto the hillsides with plate activity. The two clones are ENTAV material, budded onto devigorating rootstock. Deficit irrigation is practiced. Only 1.1 tons were harvested on October 16, 2012.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid_4 paragraphsup">
	<h2>Wine Making</h2>
		<p>The fruit was partially destemmed but not crushed into an open top fermenter with 25% whole clusters. Native yeast fermentation began in earnest 8 days later. Still fermenting juice was drained to 3 year old Francois Freres barrels. Primary did not finish until late December. Native malolactic fermentation was complete by May. The wine remained on heavy lees, was egg white fined and bottled unfiltered on August 21, 2014.</p>

	<h2>Nube Bianco Vineyard</h2>
		<p>The vineyard is planted to true Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains (France), also known as Moscato Bianco (Italy). It is one of the original Muscat genera, certainly the best for still wine production, and especially for dry still wine. It lies on the eastside of Potter Valley, southwest facing. The soil is Yokayo Series, left from river deposits dating back 100,000 years. We harvested on the morning of October 12, 2013.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid_4 paragraphsup">
	<h2>Wine Making</h2>
		<p>The fruit was whole cluster pressed and settled for two days. It was then racked to a small stainless tank where a cold fermentation to dryness took place over three weeks. The dry wine and all solids were then transferred to neutral Francois Freres barrels. The lees were stirred every two weeks for three months. It was racked to the bottling tank for settling mid February and was bottled on March 21, 2014.</p>

	<h2>Niemi Vineyard</h2>
		<p>In the heart of Redwood Valley, Niemi Vineyard sits on a slightly west facing bench well above the Russian River Plain. Proprietor Alvin Tollini farms his head pruned, dry farmed vines traditionally, cross cultivating and hand hoeing under the vines. The alluvial soil is predominantly Redvine Series. Only 2.1 tons were picked from our one-acre block on October 5, 2013.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid_4 paragraphsup">
	<h2>Wine Making</h2>
		<p>The cool fruit was partly destemmed but not crushed into an open top fermenter. Native yeast began in earnest 9 days later, and the cap was managed with both punch downs and pumpovers. At dryness, only free run juice was drained to 4 year old Francois Freres barrels. Native malolactic finished in late spring. The wine was egg white fined and bottled unfiltered on June 18, 2015.</p>

		<p>This magical vineyard sits on bench at the base of the eastern foothills of Redwood Valley. Amongst the ten acres of 70 year old red field blend varieties lie 230 French Colombard vines, planted intermittently. The alluvial soil is Yokayo Series. Peter Chevalier farms these old, dry farmed, head pruned vines traditionally, cross cultivating and hand hoeing under the vines. Half of a ton of fruit was hand picked on October 3, 2015.</p>
