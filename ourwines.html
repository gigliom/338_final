	<h2>Chevalier Vineyard</h2>
		<p>Mendocino County</p>
		<p>pH: 3.84</p>
		<p>TA: 0.57</p>
		<p>Alcohol: 15.5%</p>
		<p>The Chevalier Vineyard sits on a steep east facing hillside looking over Lake Mendocino. Both Yokayo and Pinole Series soils are present, in the grouping of alluvial river bottom soils pushed up onto the hillsides with plate activity. The two clones are ENTAV material, budded onto devigorating rootstock. Deficit irrigation is practiced. Only 1.1 tons were harvested on October 16, 2012.</p>
</div>
<div class="grid_4">
	<h2>Wine Making</h2>
		<p>The fruit was partially destemmed but not crushed into an open top fermenter with 25% whole clusters. Native yeast fermentation began in earnest 8 days later. Still fermenting juice was drained to 3 year old Francois Freres barrels. Primary did not finish until late December. Native malolactic fermentation was complete by May. The wine remained on heavy lees, was egg white fined and bottled unfiltered on August 21, 2014.</p>
